Project Description

The phonebook will be used to hold information such as name, phone number, email, and addresses. This project demonstrates the working of a phone book application and data structures like simple lists, linked lists, and dictionaries. The phonebook will have capabilities such as:
Add contact to give our users the ability to add a new contact and provide details such as name, surname, email address, phone number, and address. The phone, address, and email can be more than one and are stored in a list.

Edit contact will enable our users to edit the details saved on a registered contact where there are changes needed.  The following details can be edited; name, surname, email, phone, and address. 

The Get size option will enable our users to get the number of contacts available. 

Delete contacts will enable the user to remove contacts from the phonebook. 

Get details once the user selects this option on any contact it will show all details saved on that contact in the list. 

View all will show all stored contacts in the userâ€™s list. 

Search gives users the option to search for any contact saved. 

Get all emails option will display all emails saved in the contacts. 

Get all phones gives users the ability to get all the present addresses in the phonebook either for one contact or all contacts.

Get all addresses gives the user the ability to get all the present addresses in the phonebook either for one contact or all contacts.
The phonebook will have validations for different fields such as names and email addresses to ensure that they meet specific requirements. The phonebook will have a persistent memory and MySQL will be used to provide storage.
