## Purpose Data Structure and Algorithms Used
**Linked List** :
Used in contacts to represent a contact in a phone book. Holds details such as names, phone, addresses and emails. Operations such as get next node and set next node are implemented to enable actions such as retrieval of contacts details. 

**Simple List** :
Used to store user emails, phones and addresses. A contact may have more than one phone, email or address. The items can be accessed using indexes. Operations such as get the length of a list which gets the number of phones or emails present in a collection.

**Dictionary** : 
Used to store the user contacts. The whole phonebook is represented using a dictionary and the contacts are stored as; key and value which represent name and the contact object respectively. Operations such as searching a contact, getting all contacts and number of contacts present are made possible. 
## Project Description

The phonebook will be used to hold information such as name, phone number, email, and addresses. This project demonstrates the working of a phone book application and data structures like simple lists, linked lists, and dictionaries. The phonebook will have capabilities such as:
Add contact to give our users the ability to add a new contact and provide details such as name, surname, email address, phone number, and address. The phone, address, and email can be more than one and are stored in a list.

Edit contact will enable our users to edit the details saved on a registered contact where there are changes needed.  The following details can be edited; name, surname, email, phone, and address. 

The Get size option will enable our users to get the number of contacts available. 

Delete contacts will enable the user to remove contacts from the phonebook. 

Get details once the user selects this option on any contact it will show all details saved on that contact in the list. 

View all will show all stored contacts in the userâ€™s list. 

Search gives users the option to search for any contact saved. 

Get all emails option will display all emails saved in the contacts. 

Get all phones gives users the ability to get all the present addresses in the phonebook either for one contact or all contacts.

Get all addresses gives the user the ability to get all the present addresses in the phonebook either for one contact or all contacts.
The phonebook will have validations for different fields such as names and email addresses to ensure that they meet specific requirements. 
## Motivation
Nowadays building an application that helps the community to do a specific task in a convenient way is the most important thing. There are a number of reasons why we want to do this program. After observing the current phonebook apps available, we identified that users would like an easy-to-use and efficient app for phonebooks. We want to learn how to build efficient programs and good performance. We also want to get the knowledge on how to design and build data structures that are efficient. We want to build a phonebook which provides more features. Another thing, we have seen that it is not enough for someone to have only names and phone numbers in the phonebook. We aim to build a phonebook that takes more details about the user.

Asymptotic upper bound, O-notation is used to analyze all the algorithms below.

## Solution
A phonebook program is a simple program that simulates a contact book. A typical contacts book is used to hold the names of people and their contact details. Contact details can be as simple as phone numbers only or a range of more information such as email addresses and addresses. Our phonebook program is a complete phonebook which has the following five important information:
* Name
* Surname
* Phone
* Email
* Address  

The phone, email, and address are lists that hold multiple elements of the details. The community will benefit from our program in many ways but to mention a few:
* An all-in-one solution for storing multiple details about contact such as email address and addresses. This beats the traditional phonebook, which has only phone numbers.
* It is giving the community a chance to add multiple values to phones, emails, and addresses. This provides the user with the convenience of having all the ways of reaching loved ones or colleagues. 
* Our phonebook program is efficient and reliable. This is enabled by the use of efficient algorithms to save or retrieve values of the contact details. 
* The program also has a simple and intuitive interface for the user to have an easy time interacting with it.
