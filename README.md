Motivation


Nowadays building an application that helps the community to do a specific task in a convenient way is the most important thing. There are a number of reasons why we want to do this program. After observing the current phonebook apps available, we identified that users would like an easy-to-use and efficient app for phonebooks. We want to learn how to build efficient programs and good performance. We also want to get the knowledge on how to design and build data structures that are efficient. We want to build a phonebook which provides more features. Another thing, we have seen that it is not enough for someone to have only names and phone numbers in the phonebook. We aim to build a phonebook that takes more details about the user.
