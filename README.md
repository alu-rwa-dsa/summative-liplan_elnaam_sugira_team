## Purpose Those Data Structure and Algorithms
**Linked List** :
Used in contacts to represent a contact in a phone book. Holds details such as names, phone, addresses and emails. Operations such as get next node and set next node are implemented to enable actions such as retrieval of contacts details.

Operations such as searching a contact, getting all contacts and number of contacts present are made possible.
